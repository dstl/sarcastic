# Material Properties File
# Version 1.0
# Put comments in here
# 
# This file contains the scattering properties of various materials used by sarcastic
# You can change any of the variables in this file or add more materials as you see fit.
# If you add a material line then its critically important that you change the line
# below starting with NMATERIALS to be followed by the number of materials in the table.
# This number is used by the sarcastic tools to know how many materials to read.
# 
# Parameter Descriptions
# ----------------------
#
# id        : This is the index of the material number in the table and is used to
#      cross reference parameters throughout the execution of sarcastic tools.
#
# Name      : This is the name of the material. If colladaToPlyFile is run then these 
#   names are searched in the collada file to work out which material each facet is 
#   made of. This is useful if you use Sketchup to make your CAD model as you can 
#   'paint' the facets in the CAD model with the paint tool and the color description
#   of the paint will be associated with one of the names in the table below if the
#   paint name matches.
#
# corrLen   : This is the correlation length of the facet. It is used when decomposing
#   the triangle mesh into Delaunay triangles and sets the maximum area for each 
#   Delaunay triangle.
#
# Roughness : After Delaunay triangulation the mesh triangles are distorted in the
#   direction of the triangle normal by a random amount. The standard deviation of 
#   the distortions are this number.
#
# Rs        : Electrical resistivity of the material
# Rm        : Magnetic conductivity of the surface material
# Specular  : The amount of ray energy passed forward in the specular direction
#Â   after each bounce.
# Diffuse   : The amount of energy scattered diffusely after each bounce (not used)
# Shinyness : Not used
# R,G,B     : Used for colouring each material when saving the triangles to a .ply file
#
