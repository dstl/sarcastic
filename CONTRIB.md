I wrote SARCASTIC as part of my PHD thesis [1][1] which was funded by the UK's Ministry of Defence (Jointly the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (JARIC).

Aside from the funding I had a lot of help from many very smart people. They are (in no particular order):

* Dave Blacknell
* Matt Nottingham
* Darren Muff
* Natalie Ernst
* Dan Andre
* Malcolm Stevens

I also had a lot of support from scientists and engineers in the United States, predominantly from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). It would be unfair / inappropriate to name individuals but I would specifically like to thanks Charles 'Jack' Jakowatz, who was a great pioneer of fine resolution SAR processing and sadly died in Feb 2015.

Special thanks also go to the scientists in the Commonwealth Scientific labs in Australia (DST Group), Canada (DRDC) and New Zealand (DTA).

And of course big thanks to my wife Joanne and my annoyingly inquisitive kids, Jake and Jed, who despite their best efforts are now at university studying Physics and Electronic Engineering respectively.
